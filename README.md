# Groff Tutorial 

Here we look at groff. A super simple text editor. You can properly formatted PDFs almost like Tex in a wayy easier manner.

## Why?
- Super easy
- Probably inbuilt
- Amazing support for equations and the like
- Much much easier sytax than latex
- Comparable to markdown
- Idk. Its just cool and nice to do complex stuff easily especially if you are used to terminal based workflows.

## Example
- Check the groffTutorial.pdf file. This was generated by groff itself.
- Other versions or better tutorials will be added in time.

## Contributions
- 100% welcome :))
